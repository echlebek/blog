    <h2 class="h2 black regular h0-responsive">Career Goals</h2>
    <p class="h3 ml2">Computer Programming</p>
    <p class="ml3">
    As a software developer, my goal is to facilitate computing as a medium for interaction, collaboration, and design. A poorly-crafted computer
    program can cause feelings of intense frustration. A well-crafted computer program will do its job quietly, and get out of the way.
    From the perspective of the user, programs must be fast, functional, resilient, and understandable.
    </p>
    <p class="h3 ml2">Software Architecture and Engineering</p>
    <p class="ml3">
    As a software engineer, my goal is to collaborate with a team to achieve a consistent vision of a product, and develop a formal description
    of that product. I rely heavily on cross-communication between functional groups to achieve this. Often, effective communication can result
    in large amounts of work being avoided, or better targeted.
    </p>
    <p class="h3 ml2">Leadership</p>
    <p class="ml3">
    In a leadership role, I do my best to teach to, and learn from others. I look for opportunities to transfer knowledge, and avoid silos.
    When reviewing the work of others, I do my best to ask questions instead of making statements. I aim to provide critique instead of criticism.
    Being patient is better than being demanding. Showing is better than telling.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h2 black regular h0-responsive">Work Experience</h2>
    <p class="h3 ml2">
    Software Developer, <a class="black" href="https://www.go2mobi.com">Go2mobi</a> <span class="ml2 italic">(2016-)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    At Go2mobi, my efforts are focused around developing and maintaining a real-time bidder system for advertising exchanges. Go2mobi handles many requests per second, hitting
    1M in 2017. The company began with a Python stack but quickly outgrew it, moving to Go in 2015. Many of the services I've developed at Go2mobi are highly scalable
    and performant. Working at Go2mobi has taught me the value of metrics for visibility into service behaviour.
    <p class="ml3">
    Go2mobi uses a blend of traditional, modern, and unconventional tools, and I've gained experience working with Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, Redis and Aerospike while working there.
    The software development team works at a fast pace, and takes on daring and audacious projects on a regular basis.

    Software Developer, <a class="black" href="http://www.zymeworks.com">Zymeworks Inc.</a> <span class="ml2 italic">(2010-2016)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    My career as a software developer at Zymeworks, a biopharmaceuticals company, began with writing command-line Python applications for scientists.
    I soon graduated to writing HPC workflows for the protein engineering department. One of my workflows, although simple,
    proved to be very successful and was integrated into many standard protein engineering SOPs.
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    Over time, I was tasked with more difficult assignments. I've worked on, maintained or integrated most of the software systems at Zymeworks, including a molecular
    dynamics simulator written in C, a protein packing application written in Python, and many others.
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    I helped to introduce <a class="black" href="http://www.knime.com">KNIME</a> to Zymeworks, by writing tools that allowed
    <a class="black" href="http://www.knime.com">KNIME</a> to read Zymeworks' proprietary file formats. KNIME became a huge success at Zymeworks,
    and I still maintain many systems related to it today.
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    I've also created or maintained several apps in Angular and React. I prefer React by far, and found it easy to
    build reusable, testable components with it.
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    At Zymeworks, my interests and efforts were solidly in the back-end, writing servers in Go backed by PostgresQL. I tried to create simple, robust
    and testable systems that were straightforward to modify and maintain. Later on, I took an interest in automation and devops, as the company was growing
    at a fast clip. Although I prefer working on back-end systems, I often find myself wearing the "full-stack" developer hat, which I am comfortable with.
    </p>

    <p class="h3 ml2">
    Software Developer, Terahertz Solutions Inc. <span class="ml2 italic">(2009-2010)</span>
    <p class="ml3">
    I implemented the software component of a terahertz radiation scanner used in the forest products industry.
    This product was similar to a desktop scanner, with a data collector that moved back and forth across a factory line.
    I programmed the motion controller and data acquisition system, which were synchronized to collect nanosecond-resolution
    time-series data. Unfortunately, the company could not afford to employ me full-time and I was forced to seek employment elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    As the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for every aspect of software development, including programming,
    user interface design, deployment, testing, and automation. While I was far too inexperienced at the time to perform all of these
    roles properly, I was able to deliver a working product that reliably scanned and collected data. The product was written in NI Labview
    and communicated with a data acquisition machine over raw UDP sockets. The motion controller was programmed in a domain-specific language similar to assembler.
    My only teammates were an electrical engineer who designed the robotics hardware, and a physicist who headed the project and developed
    the mathematics for analyzing the terahertz time-series data.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="h3 ml2">
    IT Administrator, <a href="http://www.unbc.ca" class="black">University of Northern British Columbia</a> <span class="ml2 italic">(2008)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    As a temporary replacement systems administrator, I oversaw the operations of the UNBC GIS lab. The GIS lab ran a mixture of Windows 2000 and SuSE Linux,
    and had sophisticated and demanding users who generated massive amounts of data. The job had plenty of challenges, and I was often left to my own devices.
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    A few weeks into the job, I realized that the backup system had completely failed due to a software installation and upgrade failure. The system was completely unmonitored.
    I analyzed the backup software execution with <span class="italic courier">strace</span> and discovered that some crucial dependencies were failing to load. Once I installed
    the dependencies, the system came back online. I then coordinated with the UNBC IT department to ensure that the backup system was being monitored by their staff.
    </p>
    <p class="ml3">
    As a budding computer programmer, I wrote software that collected and analyzed disk usage statistics and presented a pie chart of disk usage by user. I discovered that three people were using over 75% of the storage
    provided by the GIS department. This allowed me to coax these users into reducing any unnecessary files, reclaiming many gigabytes of space.
    </p>

    I am a focused and motivated individual who enjoys working alone or as part of a team. In a team
    setting, I often take on leadership roles. I am known for being able to learn new things on the job -
    a critical skill for a person in my field. I often take on tasks that I have little or no experience in, and
    succeed.

    <p class="ml3">
    In my spare time I enjoy playing guitar, a hobby I have pursued for over 19 years. As for physical
    fitness, I enjoy cycling, running, and skiing. I am an experienced back-country hiker and skier and
    have spent hundreds of hours traversing the mountains of BC.
