E. C. Manning Park
------------------

After celebrating Christmas, my friends (B and K) and I decided to go camping and ski touring
at E. C. Manning Park. Manning is a large provincial park on the #3 Crowsnest highway
between Hope and Princeton. It is situated within the Canadian cascade mountains, and
has many peaks over 2000 metres.

Manning Park has a ski area called Gibsons Pass, and offers single-ride tickets for $10.
This enables easy ski-touring access without a long climb up.

Snow Camping at Lone Duck Campground
------------------------------------

After arriving home, I hastily packed my car with all of my winter gear and every
single piece of warm clothing I owned. I knew that when the weather cleared,
temperatures were expected to drop to -14 or lower, so proper preparation was essential.

As I drove east on the #1, I felt excited. Last winter had been utterly demoralizing in terms
of snowfall. Would I find the deep, dry, powder that I was seeking? All signs looked good;
cold weather, and plenty of precipitation. The avalanche report was low across the province.
Total bomber conditions.

By the time I took the turnoff to the #3, the ground was already snowy. The roads were generally
clear of snow, but there were some tricky sections on the route. After a few kilometers of
steady climbing, the temperature dropped to -5 C. Light snow was falling, but not enough to
be an impediment to my driving.

Arriving at the campsite, I met up with my companions and pitched my tent as quickly as
possible. The snowfall was kind enough to let up, and my friends helped me set up, as
they had arrived the previous day. We shared some hot drinks, and went to sleep.

Slack-Country Touring at Gibson's Pass Ski Area
-----------------------------------------------

The next day, we woke to still air, high overcast skies, and gently falling snow. The flakes were large, around 2 mm.
We took it slow, preparing pancakes and tea. At around 10 am we headed to the ski resort.

We took it easy the first day, taking a trail towards Poland Lake. This trail can be accessed by
heading west from the longer chair life. We deviated from the Poland Lake trail
to take some short, easy runs on a small rounded peak. The timber was quite thick in the area,
which necessitated some tricky turns here and there. After around six short runs, we decided to
head out.

That night, the skies cleared and the temperatures dropped. Expecting colder temperatures, we
boiled water and put hot water bottles into our sleeping bags. This helped our comfort levels a
lot. My car's thermometer read -14 the following morning.

K's Jeep wasn't starting. The cold, combined with frequent short car trips, had taken its toll on
the car's battery. We jumped the Jeep using my car, and headed off to the ski resort once again.

When we arrived at the top of the chair lift, we were treated to some great scenery.

This time, we headed off to the east of the chair lift to access some steeper terrain. We took our
time, carefully exploring the terrain. None of us had traveled in the area before, so we didn't
get many turns in. Again, thick timber was somewhat problematic but better on the east side.

Finally after a lot of walking about, we took some short runs on the south face. We quickly realized
that a large temperature inversion combined with clear skies had started increasing the density of
the snow, and after a few turns we decided to travel back to the resort. Skiing on the west face
back to the resort, we got some better turns in. We agreed that if we returned to the resort, the better
skiing would likely be on the west aspect.

Zoa Ridge
---------

After skiing at Gibson's Pass, the cold weather really started to sink in. We packed up camp and made tracks for
Hope, and spent the night at a hotel. We rose before dawn to eat a "continental breakfast", and headed north on
the Coquihalla.

Zoa ridge is accessible via Falls Lake road, near the Coquihalla summit. The trail follows a very wide pipeline
right-of-way for a few kilometers before entering heavy timber. On the other side of the ridge, the trees
are more sparse, and there are many excellent slopes for skiing.

Starting out at the trailhead, I was freezing. The temperature was -14. I put on my down jacket, even
though I knew it would become sweaty while climbing. The temperature inversion was also in effect in this
region, and as we got higher up the temperatures became less bitter, even warm by the time we made it
to the top of the ridge.

We climbed for three hours. The trail was quite easy for the most part, but involved some steep sections
that necessitated the use of our climbing bars. Snowmobile tracks complicated matters somewhat in narrow areas,
as we were unable to properly traverse due to the deep, packed tracks.

The top of the ridge was fantastically beautiful.

In the image below, on the right, there are many runs possible. We did not ski down all the way, but another traveler mentioned to us
that the runs come out at a power line, which would be a helpful rallying point. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough
time to ski more than a single run on these slopes. However, the run we did was easily the best run I've had this year, and I made
well over 20 tight turns in the perfect powder. Skiing down was also quite enjoyable, particularly on the pipeline, although it was
quite tracked out.

This was my first visit to both Gibson's Pass ski area and Zoa Ridge. I would say that Zoa ridge offers more opportunities
for the skilled backcountry skier, but Gibson's Pass is a gentler introduction for new skiers and should not be overlooked.
Zoa Ridge certainly holds a special place in my heart - it is basically a perfect backcountry ski area. Views, powder, 30 degree
slopes. What's not to love?
