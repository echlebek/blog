Revelstoke
----------

[Revelstoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelstoke,_British_Columbia)
is not easy to get to. It's a historic railway town in the south-east
quadrant of BC, and the drive there from Vancouver is over 600 km. It also
has a ski resort with the longest vertical descent (1713m) in North America.

Luckily, Revelstoke is well stocked with inexpensive motel rooms and
vacation rental homes at very reasonable rates. A big mountain next to
a small town.

Revelstoke receives a lot of snow. I'd been hearing about it for years,
and to some extent I regret not visiting it before the resort as we know
it today opened in 2007.

When we arrived, there had been no new snow in quite some time. Dustings
at best. The resort was completely tracked out, and the snow on most of
the runs was hard and unyielding. Avalanche risk was low in the alpine,
so we packed our touring gear and headed out of bounds.

Avalanche Ranch
---------------

The resort has an area at the top of the Stoke chair called the Avalanche
Ranch. Courtesy of BCA, the Avalanche Ranch has eight different beacons permanently buried
in boxes in the snow. Users can turn on any of the eight beacons and search
for their signals to practice their avalanche rescue skills.

It's great to see a ski resort that is in-tune with ski touring and offering
facilities like this.

A Short Walk
------------

Revelstoke has some reasonably mellow terrain not far from the resort.
While many sites feature stunningly steep images of the Revy backcountry,
there are other slopes as well.

Caution Required
----------------

While some slopes at Revelstoke are mellow, others are not. Complex terrain
is everywhere, and care is definitely required when making route choices.

Saddle Run
----------

The saddle provided us with a nice flat slope. Although we were seeing
some slough on the surface snow, the snow was very well-consolidated
underneath. However, the sun was taking its toll, and it seemed like the
conditions were changing quickly. When we started the hike up, the pill-balls
that can be seen on the slope were not present. So, we traveled elsewhere
after a single run here.

Worth the Trip
--------------

I have to say I had an excellent time skiing at Revelstoke. The resort is
much cheaper than Whistler and still offers real big-mountain skiing.
On a sunny day, there are some awesome sights to see as well.
